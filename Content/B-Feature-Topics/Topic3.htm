        <p style="text-align: center;">The most famous tourist attraction in Pszczyna is the castle. In 2009 it was voted as one of the Seven Architectural Wonders of the Silesian Voivodeship. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">The castle was first built in the 13th century so its history is very long! At that time it was inhabited by Polish Piast nobles. Over the centuries, it changed ownership several times. 70% of the equipment in the castle is original, nothing has been damaged or looted over the years. </MadCap:conditionalText>The castle is characterized by rich, luxurious decor. There are living rooms, an impressive hall of mirrors and an armory with rich equipment. By visiting it, you can admire the conditions in which wealthy people from past eras lived.
