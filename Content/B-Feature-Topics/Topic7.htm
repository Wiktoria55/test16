        <p style="text-align: center;">The map shows a chapel called "Thy Will Be Done" - the chapel is located at the fork of the former trade routes leading from Pszczyna to the west and south. This is a unique place for all&#160; residents due to an interesting legend circulating about it. The story is related to the escape from Krakow of King Henry Valois, who fled to France through Pszczyna to take the French throne there as Henry III. According to legend, on June 19, 1575, chamberlain Jan Tęczyński stopped the king in this place, asking him to return to Wawel. The king did not agree and thinking about his French homeland, he uttered the words "Thy will be done".</p>
