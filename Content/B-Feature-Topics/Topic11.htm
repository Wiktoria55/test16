        <p style="text-align: center;">Walking along the main street of Pszczyna - Piastowska, we will notice a small building that houses a museum. This is a special place because the first Polish-language newspaper in Upper Silesia was printed here, "Tygodnik Polski Poświęciony Włościanom", which was published in 1845-1846. In the museum we can see historic printing machines as well as a large collection of Polish newspapers. On the first floor there is the "Telemann Room", which serves as a small concert hall. You can also see a collection of musical instruments from Upper Silesia here. To learn more about the place, press <a href="http://www.muzeumprasy.pl/" class="link3">here</a>.</p>
